# MRF
# Goal: Jointly estimate network parameters with latent variables
# Difficulties: Normalizing factor C(beta) intractable
# Method: 1. Pseudo-likelihood Estimator
# Method: 2. Approximate C(beta) by EM analytically or by sampling from MCMC
# Method: 3. Auxiliary variables and perfect sampling
# Method: 4. Likelihood-Free Methods
# Method: 5. Mean field-like approximations
